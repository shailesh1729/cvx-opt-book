# Subspace Topology

Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Let $Y \subseteq X$. 
Recall that $(Y, d)$ is a metric subspace with the
distance function $d$ restricted to $Y \times Y$.

```{prf:remark}
Let $Y$ be a metric subspace of $X$ and $S \subseteq Y$.
The interior, closure and boundary of $S$ w.r.t. $X$ 
and w.r.t. $Y$ may be different.

If a subspace hasn't been specified, by default, we shall
assume that we are computing the interior, closure and 
boundary w.r.t. the metric space $X$.
```


```{prf:proposition}
Let $Y$ be a metric subspace of $X$. Let $S \subseteq Y$.

$S$ is open in $Y$ if and only if $S = O \cap Y$ where $O$ 
is an open subset of $X$.
```

```{prf:proof}
abc
```

```{prf:example}
* $[0, 1)$ is open in the metric space $\RR_+$.
