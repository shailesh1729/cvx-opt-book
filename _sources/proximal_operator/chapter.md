# Proximal Algorithms


## Chapter Objectives

* Proximal mappings
* Existence and uniqueness of proximal mappings for proper, closed, convex functions
* Proximal operators


## Relevant results

We recall some results from previous chapters which will be
helpful for the work in this chapter.

* Sum of two closed functions is a closed function.
* Some of a convex function with a strongly convex function is strongly convex.
* A proper, closed and strongly convex function has a unique minimizer.


For some convex $f: \RR \to \RERL$:

* If $f'(u) = 0$, then $u$ must be one of its minimizers.
* If the minimizer of $f$ exists and is not attained at any point of 
  differentiability, then it must be attained at a point of nondifferentiability.
