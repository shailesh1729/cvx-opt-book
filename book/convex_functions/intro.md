We will primarily be considered with functions 
of type $\EE \to \VV$ where $\EE$ and $\VV$ are
inner product spaces.

In particular, we will concern ourselves with 
real valued functions $\EE \to \RR$ from an 
inner product space $\EE$ to real line. 
Their extensions $\tilde{f} : \EE \to [-\infty, \infty]$
will play a crucial role in simplifying analysis.
Real-valued functions are equipped with a total order in the codomain
$\RR$. Thus, it is possible to compare $f(x)$ with $f(y)$
for some $x, y \in \EE$ to establish whether 
$f(x) < f(y)$ or $f(x) = f(y)$ or $f(x) > f(y)$.

Examples of inner product spaces:

- Euclidean space $\RR^n$
- Space of matrices $\RR^{m \times n}$
- Space of symmetric matrices $\SS^n$.
