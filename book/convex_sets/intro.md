# Convex Sets


## Chapter Objectives

* Affine sets and subspaces
* Convex set definitions
* Different types of convex sets
* Properties of convex sets
* Convexity preserving operations
* Generalized inequalities on convex cones


We recall that 

```{div}
* $\RR$ denotes the real line
* $\ERL$ denotes the extended real line
* $\RR_+$ denotes the set of nonnegative reals.
* $\RR_{++}$ denotes the set of positive reals.
```


## Real Vector Spaces

We shall concern ourselves with subsets of real vector spaces.
The scalar field associated with real vector spaces is $\RR$.
The vector spaces are denoted by $\VV$ or $\EE$.

* We shall exclusively work with finite dimensional vector spaces.
* The vector space is endowed with a *real* inner product whenever required.
* The vector space is endowed with a norm induced by the inner product whenever required.  

Examples of inner product spaces:

- Euclidean space $\RR^n$
- Space of matrices $\RR^{m \times n}$
- Space of symmetric matrices $\SS^n$.
