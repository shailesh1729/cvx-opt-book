# Convex Sets


## Chapter objectives

* Convex set definitions
* Different types of convex sets
* Properties of convex sets
* Convexity preserving operations
* Generalized inequalities on convex cones


We shall concern ourselves with subsets of an 
inner product space $\VV$ over $\RR$.

* $\VV$ is a vector space.
* We shall exclusively work with finite dimensional vector spaces.
* $\VV$ is endowed with a *real* inner product.
* $\VV$ is endowed with a norm induced by the inner product.  
* The scalar field associated with the vector space $\EE$ is $\RR$.

Examples of inner product spaces:

- Euclidean space $\RR^n$
- Space of matrices $\RR^{m \times n}$
- Space of symmetric matrices $\SS^n$.
