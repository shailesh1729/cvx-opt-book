## Algebraic Structures

In mathematics, the term *algebraic structure* refers to an arbitrary set 
with one or more operations defined on it.

* Simpler algebraic structures include groups, rings, and fields. 
* More complex algebraic structures like vector spaces are built 
  on top of the simpler structures.
